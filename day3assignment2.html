<p> JavaScript is dynamically typed (also called loosely typed) scripting language. That is, in javascript variables can receive different data types over time. Datatypes are basically typed of data that can be used and manipulated in a program.

The latest ECMAScript(ES6) standard defines seven data types: Out of which six data types are Primitive(predefined).


    Numbers: 5, 6.5, 7 etc.
    String: “Hello GeeksforGeeks” etc.
    Boolean: Represent a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.
    Null: This type has only one value : null.
    Undefined: A variable that has not been assigned a value is undefined.
    Object: It is the most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. We will learn about these data types in details in further articles.
    Symbol: It is a primitive data type of JavaScript, along with string, number, boolean, null and undefined. It was introduced in ECMAScript 2015, so just a few years ago. It's a very peculiar data type. Once you create a symbol, its value is kept private and for internal use
